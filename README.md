## Contributing to an Existing Chart

We'd love for you to contribute to an existing Chart that you find provides a useful application or service for Kubernetes. Please read our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how you can contribute Charts.

## Owning and Maintaining A Chart

Individual charts can be maintained by one or more users of [OWNERS](OWNERS). When someone maintains a chart they have the access to merge changes to that chart. To have merge access to a chart someone needs to:

1. Be listed on the chart, in the [OWNERS](OWNERS) file, as a maintainer. If you need sponsors and have contributed to the chart, please reach out to the existing maintainers, or if you are having trouble connecting with them, please reach out to one of the [OWNERS](OWNERS) of the charts repository.

## Review Process

For information related to the review procedure used by the Chart repository maintainers, see [Merge approval and release process](CONTRIBUTING.md).
