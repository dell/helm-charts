## Report bugs

We aim to track and document everything related to this repo via the Issues page. The code and documentation are released with no warranties or SLAs and are intended to be supported through a community driven process.

Before submitting a new issue, try to make sure someone hasn't already reported the problem. Look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/issues) for similar issues.

Report a bug by submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/issues/new?labels=type%2Fbug%2C+needs-triage&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%3A+%5Bchart+name+%28if+applicable%29%5D%3A+bug+title). Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

When opening a Bug please include the following information to help with debugging:

1. Version of relevant software: this software, Kubernetes, Dell Storage Platform, Helm, etc.
2. Details of the issue explaining the problem: what, when, where
3. The expected outcome that was not met (if any)
4. Supporting troubleshooting information. **Note: Do not provide private company information that could compromise your company's security.**

An Issue **must** be created before submitting any pull request. Any pull request that is created should be linked to an Issue.

## Feature request

If you have an idea of how to improve Dell Community Kubernetes Helm Charts, submit a [feature request](https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/issues/new?labels=type%2Ffeature-request%2C+needs-triage&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D%3A+%5Bchart+name+%28if+applicable%29%5D%3A+feature+title).

## Answering questions

If you have a question and you can't find the answer in the documentation or issues, the next step is to submit a [question](https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/issues/new?labels=type%2Fquestion&template=ask-a-question.md&title=%5BQUESTION%5D%3A+%5Bchart+name+%28if+applicable%29%5D%3A+question+title).

We'd love your help answering questions being asked by other Dell Community Kubernetes Helm Charts users.

## Triage issues

Triage helps ensure that issues resolve quickly by:

- Ensuring the issue's intent and purpose is conveyed precisely. This is necessary because it can be difficult for an issue to explain how an end user experiences a problem and what actions they took.
- Giving a contributor the information they need before they commit to resolving an issue.
- Lowering the issue count by preventing duplicate issues.
- Streamlining the development process by preventing duplicate discussions.

If you don't have the knowledge or time to code, consider helping with _issue triage_. The community will thank you for saving them time by spending some of yours.

Read more about the ways you can [Triage issues](docs/ISSUE_TRIAGE.md).

## Your first contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Dell Community Kubernetes Helm Charts? Start by browsing issues labeled `beginner friendly` or `help wanted`.

- [Beginner-friendly](https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22) issues are generally straightforward to complete.

When you're ready to contribute, it's time to create a pull request.

## Branching Strategy

We are following a scaled trunk branching strategy where short-lived branches are created off of the main branch. When coding is complete, the branch is merged back into main after being approved in a pull request code review.

### Branch Naming Convention

| Branch Type | Example                          | Comment                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| main        | main                             |                                          |
| Release     | release-1.0                      | hotfix: release-1.1 patch: release-1.0.1 |
| Feature     | feature-9-olp-support            | "9" referring to GitHub issue ID         |
| Bug Fix     | bugfix-110-remove-docker-compose | "110" referring to GitHub issue ID       |

### Branch Types

- A Release branch is a branch created from the main branch used for releasing a Helm Chart version. Only critical bug fixes will be merged into this branch.
- Bug Fix branch is a branch which is created for the purpose of fixing the given defect/issue.
- Feature branch is created for a feature development purpose.

### Steps to create a branch for a bug fix or feature

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch off of the main branch. The branch name should follow [branch naming convention](#branch-naming-convention).
3. Write code, add tests, and commit to your branch. Optionally, add feature flags to disable any new features that are not yet ready for the release.
4. If other code changes have merged into the upstream main branch, perform a rebase of those changes into your branch.
5. Open a [pull request](#pull-requests) between your branch and the upstream main branch.
6. Once your pull request has merged, your branch can be deleted.

Release branches will be created from the main branch near the time of a planned release when all features are completed. Only critical bug fixes will be merged into the release branch at this time. All other bug fixes and features can continue to be merged into the main branch. When the release branch is stable, the branch will be tagged for release.

## Signing your commits

We require that developers sign off their commits to certify that they have permission to contribute the code in a pull request. This way of certifying is commonly known as the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). We encourage all contributors to read the DCO text before signing a commit and making contributions.

GitHub will prevent a pull request from being merged if there are any unsigned commits.

### Signing a commit

GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) will be used to sign commits. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits) to create a GPG key and configure your GitHub account to use that key.

Make sure you have your user name and e-mail set. This will be required for your signed commit to be properly verified. Check the following references:

- Setting up your github user name [reference](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/)
- Setting up your e-mail address [reference](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/)

Once Git and your GitHub account have been properly configured, you can add the -S flag to the git commits:

```console
$ git commit -S -m your commit message
# Creates a signed commit
```

### Commit message format

Dell Community Kubernetes Helm Charts uses the guidelines for commit messages outlined in [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

## Pull requests

If this is your first time contributing to an open-source project on GitHub, make sure you read about [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

A pull request must always link to at least one GitHub issue. If that is not the case, create a GitHub issue and link it.

To increase the chance of having your pull request accepted, make sure your pull request follows these guidelines:

- Title and description matches the implementation.
- Commits within the pull request follow the formatting guidelines.
- The pull request closes one related issue.
- The pull request contains necessary tests that verify the intended behavior.
- If your pull request has conflicts, rebase your branch onto the master branch.
- Code validation checks must pass.

If the pull request fixes a bug:

- The pull request description must include `Fixes #<issue number>`.

The Dell Community Kubernetes Helm Charts team _squashes_ all commits into one when we accept a pull request. The title of the pull request becomes the subject line of the squashed commit message. We still encourage contributors to write informative commit messages, as they becomes a part of the Git commit body.

We use the pull request title when we generate change logs for releases. As such, we strive to make the title as informative as possible.

Make sure that the title for your pull request uses the same format as the subject line in the commit message.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Code Quality

In order to maintain code quality, we have defined quality gates that are automatically checked in every Pull Request. Any failed checks will block merging the Pull Request changes to the main branch. The contributor will need to update the code to address the failed checks. When the changes are committed to the Pull Request, the checks will rerun automatically. After all the checks have passed, merging to the main branch will be enabled based on maintainer approval. The following checks are used for the helm-charts repository:

- Validate linting using [helm-lint](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_lint/) on updated charts.
- Check for version increment on updated charts.
- Validate [dependency](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_dependency/) versions on parent charts.

A pull request must satisfy following for it to be merged:

- A pull request will require at least 2 maintainer approvals.
- Maintainer must perform a code review and ensure there is no malicious code.
- Maintainer must run a suite of tests that verify the quality of the code being submitted, and update the contributor if there are any failures.
- If any commits are made after the PR has been approved, the PR approval will automatically be removed and the above process must happen again.
