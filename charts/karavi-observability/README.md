# Dell Community Helm Chart for Karavi Observability

Karavi Observability can be deployed using Helm.

## Installing the Chart

For complete deployment instructions, refer to the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/dell/karavi-observability/docs/GETTING_STARTED_GUIDE.md) in the Karavi Observability Github repository.

## Supported Kubernetes Versions

This chart repository supports the latest and previous minor versions of Kubernetes. For example, if the latest minor release of Kubernetes is 1.8 then 1.7 and 1.8 are supported. Charts may still work on previous versions of Kubernetes even though they are outside the target supported window.

To provide that support the API versions of objects should be those that work for both the latest minor release and the previous one.

## Helm Chart Versioning

See the Helm chart [versioning workflow](./VERSIONING_WORKFLOW.md).
