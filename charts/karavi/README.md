## Dell Community Kubernetes Helm Chart for Karavi

Karavi can be deployed using Helm.

#### Installing the Chart
To install the helm chart:
```console
$ helm repo add dell github.com/dell/helm-charts
$ helm install karavi -n karavi --create-namespace --render-subchart-notes
```
After installation, the following deployments will be in Kubernetes:
- [karavi-topology](../karavi-topology/README.md)
- [karavi-powerflex-metrics](../karavi-powerflex-metrics/README.md)

#### Uninstalling the Chart
To uninstall/delete the deployment:
```console
$ helm delete karavi --namespace karavi 
```
The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Supported Kubernetes Versions

This chart repository supports the latest and previous minor versions of Kubernetes. For example, if the latest minor release of Kubernetes is 1.8 then 1.7 and 1.8 are supported. Charts may still work on previous versions of Kubernertes even though they are outside the target supported window.

To provide that support the API versions of objects should be those that work for both the latest minor release and the previous one.
